# URL Complete Me
Add-on to paste directly into a configurable URL and go to it with the click of a button.

Let's say you go to the same URL a lot with different variations, and you find yourself dropping down your nav bar and editing an old URL from your history. This is the extension for you.


### Examples

Go directly to a Github issue
- Configure `https://github.com/megallo/url-complete-me/issues/{}` and the next time you have copied an issue number into your clipboard, click the button and it will take you right to the issue page.

Search Amazon for something
- Get directly to `https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bicycle+pump` by configuring `https://www.amazon.com/s?k={}` and copying the words "bicycle pump" into your clipboard, then clicking the button.

### Future

Ideally this would allow multiple URLs to be configured, and the button click would drop down a list of your configured URL options.
